# Project Governance

**Open Source Reviews – Curated by GitHub Users**

This document defines the governance model for the Project. It draws on principles of rough consensus from RFC 7282 and general guidance from open-source governance practices.

# 1. Governance Philosophy

The Project is built on:

- transparency
- accountability
- community involvement
- rough consensus
- high standards of accuracy and integrity

Governance applies to all repositories and project spaces.

# 3. Decision-Making Model

## 3.1 Rough Consensus

The Project uses rough consensus as described in RFC 7282:

- strong objections must be evidence-based
- consensus does not require unanimity
- maintainers evaluate whether the community has reached agreement

## 3.2 Maintainer Authority

When consensus is unclear or deadlocked, maintainers make final decisions.

Maintainers MUST document rationale for consequential decisions.

---

# 4. Policy and Process Changes

Policy changes MUST:

- be proposed via GitHub issue or PR
- receive community input
- be approved by maintainers
- reflect rough consensus

Substantial changes SHOULD remain open for discussion for a reasonable period before adoption.

Maintainers MAY be appointed based on:

- loss of community trust

Removal decisions MUST be documented.

# 6. Moderator Lifecycle

Moderators are appointed by maintainers and MUST:

- understand governance, moderation, and conduct standards

Moderators MAY be removed for cause, following the same principles applied to maintainers.
