# Moderation Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)

**Open Source Reviews – Curated by GitHub Users**

This document describes how moderation decisions are made and enforced. The approach reflects principles found in RFC 9245 (IETF Discussion List Charter) and RFC 7154 (Guidelines for Conduct), adapted for GitHub interaction rather than mailing lists.

Moderation exists to preserve community integrity, accuracy, and fairness.

---

# 1. Moderator Responsibilities

Moderators MUST:

- apply the Code of Conduct consistently
- evaluate behavior based on impact rather than intent
- act impartially
- maintain confidentiality in reports
- recuse themselves when conflicts arise

Moderators SHOULD seek rough consensus when evaluating cases, consistent with the principles of RFC 7282.

---

# 2. Reporting Process

Reports can be submitted via:

- GitHub Issue labeled "moderation"

A report SHOULD include:

- link to problematic content
- a brief description of the concern
- any relevant context

You may also report anonymously by e-mailing a moderator directly.

---

# 3. Investigation Process

Moderators MUST:

1. Review the reported content in context.
2. Determine if it violates the Code of Conduct.
3. Consult at least one other moderator before taking action beyond a warning.
4. Document the decision internally.

Moderators MAY request additional information from involved participants.

---

# 4. Escalation Ladder

## Level 0 — Advisory Notice (Private)

A moderator contacts the participant privately to:

- describe the issue
- remind them of expectations
- provide guidance for improvement

Used for minor or first-time issues.

---

## Level 1 — Cooling-Off Request

A moderator asks the participant to refrain from activity for **5 days**.
A brief public note MAY be posted to acknowledge that moderation is underway.

---

## Level 2 — Temporary Restriction

Participation may be restricted for **14 days**.
Used for recurring issues or significant conduct violations.

Requires agreement by at least two moderators.

---

## Immediate Action

Moderators MAY apply immediate restrictions in severe cases, including:

- harassment
- threats or abusive conduct
- doxxing
- identity falsification
- manipulation of participation metrics
- undisclosed promotional activity

These decisions MUST be reviewed internally after the fact.

---

# 5. Appeals Process

Participants may appeal moderation decisions by a moderator via email.

Appeals MUST:

- present new information or context
- clearly describe why the decision should be reconsidered

A different moderator or maintainer SHOULD handle the appeal.

---

# 6. Recordkeeping

Moderators maintain private logs documenting:

- reports received
- actions taken
- rationale for decisions

This ensures consistency and transparency within the moderation team.

---

# 7. Redirecting Misplaced Content

Moderators MAY redirect users when:

- issues belong in PRs
- PR debates belong in issues
- reviews lack sufficient detail or evidence
- meta-discussions belong in Discussions
- promotional content violates community rules

This keeps project spaces organized and productive.
